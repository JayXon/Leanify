Leanify [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/JayXon/Leanify.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/JayXon/Leanify) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JayXon/Leanify.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/JayXon/Leanify/releases)
=======

Leanify is a lightweight lossless file minifier/optimizer. It removes unnecessary data (debug information, comments, metadata, etc.) and recompress the file to reduce file size. It will not reduce image quality at all.


##Features

* Support recursive minifying. (e.g. a [PNG] inside an [APK] inside a [ZIP])
* Support a wide variety of [file formats](#file-formats).
* Lightweight, one file, under 1MB, no external dependency.
* Everything is done in memory, no temporary files.
* Cross-Platform, support Windows, Mac, Linux.
* Support traverse directory recursively.
* Identify file format by its data instead of name.


##Disclaimer

I'm not respossible for any consequence of using Leanify.

**PLEASE BACKUP THE FILE BEFORE USING LEANIFY!**
